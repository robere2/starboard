# Requirements

The Starboard API strives to be compatible with both Node.js and Bun, but due to the novelty of Bun, it may not
be stable in some features. We currently target compatibility with the following runtime versions:

- Node.js: v20.8.1
- Bun: v1.0.7

The Starboard API works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

# Installation

```bash [npm]
npm i @mcsb/api
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @mcsb/api
```

```bash [pnpm]

```
