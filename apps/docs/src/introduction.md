# Starboard

Features and APIs may rapidly change. Starboard is not yet production-ready.

## Overview

Starboard is a collection of tools for developers creating software for Minecraft. Building your own web backend
should not be a requirement for a Minecraft mod. Yet, with the growing ecosystem and 
[recent changes to the Hypixel API](https://hypixel.net/threads/5364455/), the demand for an easily-adoptable solution
has never been higher. Starboard's goal is to fill that gap by offering a trivial no-code web backend that is
easy to integrate with your Minecraft mod.

While Starboard offers no-code solutions via the CLI, developers with more complex use-cases may still wish to
extend Starboard with their own logic. For this, the Starboard Framework and API may be a perfect fit for the job.
